## Functions 
Functions are probably the most important tool that javascript allows us access too. Think of a function as a little program that does one thing. In javascript we will use functions to remove code that becomes repatitive. These blocks of code can be turned into functions. With these we name them by typing

      function myFunction(){
        does something;
      }

once it has been named we can call that function where ever we want in our code by typing

      myFunction();

that will tell the function to run and do what it was set upt to do.
