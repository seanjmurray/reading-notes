## The DOM

The document object model is how javascript in your browser makes and stores the information in your site. You can tell the JS you right to go into this DOM and do things. You never change the html, you just change the DOM when you work with it. An example of this is having a button with an event listener attached to it, you could have that button change the background color of your page. The code you wrote to have that color isn't actually changed, it just tempararily changes the DOM for the page.
