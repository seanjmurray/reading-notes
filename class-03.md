From the chapters we read I would say the css box method might be one of the biggest concepts to learn. The box method is important because every element of html is treated as a box so being able to manipulate those is vital. To size things you use the height and width. You also can chage the margin which is the space outside of the box to the adjacent objects. Next comes the border which you can style and color as well as the location of the border. Next comes padding which will change the space between your content and its border.
